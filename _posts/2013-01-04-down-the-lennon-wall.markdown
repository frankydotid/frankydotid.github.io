Here it is, the happy-clappy sky  
Pouring rain unto this little guy  
Dark and grey above without shy  
Not giving a greet or even a Hi  

But seems like you understand  
This little who is walking under  
Got stressed and need a friend  
So you tell to the earth below  
To keep the breeze down and slow  

The left is the way to go  
Expect nothing but the air to breathe  
From high up keep going low  
Beauty bricks and bridges around  
The wall talks and people walk  
I see no birds and I hear no sound  

Padlocks and padlocks  
Keep your love out of the clocks  
If only love can be so simply kept  
To let my desire forever slept  

Silent trees, cold statues, and chatting ducks  
Hide some secrets with noiseless kwaks  
It is fine if you don’t want to share  
Because I’m not of you who have nothing to wear  
This season is cold and I’m not that bold  

Hoop, loop, and out to the road  
Cars and humans, we meet again  
Buildings smile big and broad  
Cherish my heart and clear my day  
So I can walk home raised up  
Thinking of light on all my way
